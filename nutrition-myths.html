        <h2>Debunking Popular Nutrition Myths</h2>
        <p>There are many misconceptions about nutrition and diet. Let’s separate fact from fiction.</p>

        <h3>Myth 1: Carbs Are Bad for You</h3>
        <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Carbohydrates are an essential energy source. Choosing whole grains, fruits, and vegetables over refined carbs is the key to a healthy diet.</p>

        <h3>Myth 2: Fat Should Be Avoided</h3>
        <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Healthy fats from sources like nuts, avocados, and olive oil are beneficial for heart health and brain function.</p>

        <h3>Myth 3: Eating Late at Night Causes Weight Gain</h3>
        <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Weight gain is determined by total calorie intake, not the time of day you eat.</p>

        <h3>Myth 4: Fresh Vegetables Are Always Healthier Than Frozen</h3>
        <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Frozen vegetables can be just as nutritious as fresh ones, as they are often frozen at peak ripeness to preserve nutrients.</p>

        <h3>Myth 5: Detox Diets Cleanse Your Body</h3>
        <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Your liver and kidneys naturally detox your body. Detox diets are unnecessary and can sometimes be harmful.</p>

        <h3>Myth 6: Protein Only Comes from Meat</h3>
        <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Plant-based sources like beans, lentils, quinoa, and nuts provide plenty of protein.</p>
