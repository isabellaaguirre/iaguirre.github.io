        <h2>Why Portion Sizes Matter</h2>
        <p>Eating appropriate portion sizes is essential for maintaining a healthy diet and avoiding overeating. Over time, portion sizes have increased, leading to higher calorie intake and potential weight gain.</p>
        
        <h2>Portion vs. Serving Size</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Serving size:</strong> The amount of food recommended on a nutrition label.</li>
            <li><strong>Portion size:</strong> The amount of food you choose to eat, which may be larger or smaller than a serving size.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>General Portion Size Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Here are some easy ways to estimate portion sizes using everyday objects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein (Meat, Fish, Poultry):</strong> A portion should be about the size of your palm (3-4 ounces).</li>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates (Pasta, Rice, Bread):</strong> A portion should be about the size of a fist (½ cup cooked pasta or rice, or one slice of bread).</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Fill half your plate with vegetables (about two fists).</li>
            <li><strong>Fats (Butter, Oils, Nuts):</strong> A portion is about the size of your thumb (one tablespoon).</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> A portion should be about the size of four dice (one ounce).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Better Portion Control</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use smaller plates to help control portion sizes.</li>
            <li>Measure food with cups or a food scale to avoid overeating.</li>
            <li>Eat slowly and listen to your body's hunger cues.</li>
            <li>When dining out, ask for a half portion or pack half of your meal to take home.</li>
            <li>Pre-portion snacks into small containers instead of eating from the bag.</li>
        </ul>
