        <h2>How to Buy Nutritious Foods on a Budget</h2>
        <p>Eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive. With smart planning and shopping habits, you can buy nutritious foods without breaking the bank.</p>

        <h2>Money-Saving Grocery Shopping Tips</h2>

        <h3>1. Plan Your Meals</h3>
        <p>Before heading to the store, create a meal plan for the week. This prevents impulse purchases and reduces food waste.</p>

        <h3>2. Make a Shopping List and Stick to It</h3>
        <p>Having a list helps you stay focused on essentials and avoid unnecessary spending.</p>

        <h3>3. Buy in Bulk</h3>
        <p>Staples like rice, beans, oats, and frozen vegetables are often cheaper in bulk and last longer.</p>

        <h3>4. Choose Seasonal Produce</h3>
        <p>Fruits and vegetables that are in season are usually more affordable and taste better.</p>

        <h3>5. Compare Prices and Look for Discounts</h3>
        <p>Check unit prices to find the best deals and take advantage of sales, coupons, and loyalty programs.</p>

        <h3>6. Opt for Store Brands</h3>
        <p>Generic or store-brand products are often just as nutritious as name brands but cost less.</p>

        <h3>7. Avoid Processed and Pre-Packaged Foods</h3>
        <p>Pre-packaged meals and snacks are usually more expensive and less healthy than fresh, whole foods.</p>

        <h3>8. Shop the Perimeter of the Store</h3>
        <p>Most nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, dairy, and fresh proteins are found along the outer aisles of grocery stores.</p>
